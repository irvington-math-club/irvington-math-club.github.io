**5/19 Meeting: Game Day**

**Wednesday Meeting: Math Club Game DAY! ⚔⚔**

Join us this Wednesday (5/19) for our second installment of the IMC’s game day! During this meeting, we will be playing several, very fun and interesting math-related games. Everyone really enjoyed our first event, so make sure to come check it out!

Good luck to everyone for AP exams these upcoming weeks!

**Math Bowl Update!**
We’d like to thank everyone who participated in our Math Bowl event this year! We hope all of you enjoyed solving the problems prepared by our officer team, and we will be sending out scores and solutions to all of the questions by next Sunday!
