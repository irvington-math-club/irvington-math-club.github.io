**5/12 Meeting: No Wednesday Meeting and Math Bowl Reminder**

**This Wednesday Meeting (5/12):**
Due to the shortened QUEST schedule this week, there will be no Wednesday meeting. Instead join us later in the week for our annual Math Bowl!

**Math Bowl Signups üìù:**
The annual Math Bowl is THIS WEEK on Thursday, May 13 from 3:30 to 4:30pm. 

If you are interested in the 2021 Math Bowl, register at irvingtonmath.club/mathbowl2021 before it‚Äôs too late!

The Math Bowl will consist of approximately 10 application-based math problems to be solved within one hour. There will be no fee for contestants (it's free!).

The bowl will be broken into three levels (Algebra I / Geometry; Algebra II / Precalculus; Calculus) with each level in separate breakout rooms. The level of test which you will be taking depends on your current math class.
