**5/5 Meeting: Generating Functions and Math Bowl Info**

G’day mates,

**This Wednesday Meeting (5/5):**
Join us this Wednesday for a lecture on Generating Functions by Ananya! Generating functions are one bridge between algebra and combinatorics, and they let you easily solve problems such as finding ways to relabel a pair of dice such that the distributions of their sum remains the same as standard dice 😀.

**Math Bowl Signups 📝:**
We are currently planning to host the annual Math Bowl on Thursday, May 13 from 3:30 to 4:30pm. If you missed it last year or are new to Irvington, this is a great chance to participate!

If you are interested in the 2021 Math Bowl, please register at http://irvingtonmath.club/mathbowl2021.

The Math Bowl will consist of approximately 10 application-based math problems to be solved in one hour; calculators will be allowed. There will be no fee for contestants (it's free!).

The bowl will be broken into three levels (Algebra I / Geometry; Algebra II / Precalculus; Calculus) with each level in separate breakout rooms. Note that we are still working to confirm extra credit. 

**Last Wednesday’s Recording 🎥:**
Did you miss the legendary Evan Chen lecture last meeting? No worries! You can find the recording of the lecture on Irvington Math Club’s materials page: http://irvingtonmath.club/materials.

Cheerio,
The Irvington Math Club Officer Team
